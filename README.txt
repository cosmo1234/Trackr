\
INSTALL ALL THE PODS BEFORE OPENING THE XCODE PROJECT :)\
\cf0 \
The app is a demo delivery system application that sends one package at a time.  \
\
The app has lots of shortcoming due to the api i used(postmate) am using the test mode of the api so they are not providing me with most of the data that i need \
\
  - They are not providing realtime longitude and latitude so i cant use realtime tracking on the map\
\
  - They dont provide ETA because am on test mode \
  \
  - Postmate can only be used in a specific location it cannot be used in nigeria so i hardcoded pickup address and  \
\
Also:\
  - The app is optimised for only iphone 6 and 6s because i got into the competition late didn't apply autolayout\
\
\cf2 #Summary\cf1 \
\cf0     Because postmate wont allow me to use phone numbers from nigeria i couldn't format the phone number text field right to match the api's  requirement so i hard-coded the number also the location postmate works in just some areas in the US so the wont allow me to use the location from the textfield, I would have used google's autocomplete address on the field.\
        The api didnt provide me with realtime longitude and latitude because am on test mode so i cannot use realtime tracking on the map.\
